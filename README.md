Problem 2: Finding even or odd

Function Name: evenOdd()

Function Description: This function will take a string as input. 
Here, the task is to check the number of characters in the given string and
if the number of characters (string length) is even, then return 'even' otherwise return 'odd'.

Problem 3: Is Less or Greater than seven

Function Name: isLGSeven()

Function Description: This function will take a number as input. 
Here, the task is to check the difference (subtraction result = inputValue - 7) between the input value and 7.
If the difference is less than 7, then return the subtraction result.
Otherwise, return the double of the input value.
Also return an error message if the given input is not a number.

Problem 4: Finding Bad data

Function Name: findingBadData()

Function Description: This function will take an array as input. This array can have positive(greater than or equal to zero) and negative (less than zero) numbers. 
Number with negative values are considered as "Bad Data" and number with positive values are considered as "Good Data".

Problem 5: Convert your gems into diamond

Function Name: gemsToDiamond()

Function Description: This function will take three numbers as input. 
These numbers refers to the number of gems of three friends.

Given that,
The power of each gems of first friend = 21
The power of each gems of second friend = 32
The power of each gems of third friend = 43

[ Here, the power of gems refers to the ability of converting each gems into diamonds.
So, we can say totalNumberOfDiamonds = (powerOfGems * numberOfGems) ]

Here, the task is to find out and return the total number of diamonds of three friends.
If the number of total diamonds is greater than double of 1000 (1000*2=2000), in that case 2000 should be subtracted from total number of diamonds and then return that value.
Also return an error message if the given inputs are not numbers.
